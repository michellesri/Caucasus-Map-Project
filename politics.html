        <p>The Caucasus is a patchwork of overlapping and often conflicting geographic, ethnic, religious, linguistic, and political boundaries.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, the region has been divided into two parts - the North Caucasus and the South Caucasus - each lying on its respective side of the Caucasus mountain range. The extreme geography of this region makes travel challenging even today and led to cultural development amid isolation over centuries.</p>

        <p>The Caucasus can also be divided along an east-west axis based on religion, with Christians (mainly in Georgia and Armenia) to the west and Muslims to the east. Majority Muslim regions can be further divided into Shia Muslims to the east and south (mainly in Azerbaijan and Iran), and Sunni Muslims to the north and southwest (mainly in Southern Russia and Turkey).</p>

            <!-- As we saw in the <a href='languages.html'>languages page</a>, all of these groups also have their own distinct languages, most of which are not mutually intelligible and many of which don’t align with ethnic or religious boundaries. Finally, the Caucasus is home to more than 35 different ethnic concentrations. They represent the geographic confluence of Europe and Asia with the Caucasian groups that have lived there for millennia.</p> -->

        <p>The region's more than 35 different ethnic groups are contained within only 6 countries.</p>

        <p>Turkey, Iran, and Russia are larger and more diverse, containing hundreds of ethnic groups. Many of these have been fighting for independence for centuries. The Chechen and Dagestani peoples, for example, have been in a state of almost constant war with Russia since 1800.</p>

        <p>The smaller countries, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, have a developed national identity and boundaries more or less aligned to their majority ethnic groups.</p>

        <p>Still, they are not without conflict. The last two centuries have been marked by Russia’s efforts to take over the area north of the Caucasus mountains. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War and continue to control disputed territory along the Black Sea and its northern border.</p>
