      <p>The Caucasus is one of the more unique areas of human civilization. Its eponymous mountain range runs on a slightly downward trajectory from the eastern shore of the Black Sea to the western edge of the Caspian; among the perennially white peaks is Europe's tallest mountain, Elbrus.</p>
      <p>Sandwiched between the Black and Caspian Seas, the region's tumultuous history has many an empire lay claim to its pastures and forests - from Greeks and Mongols to Byzantines, Ottomans, and Soviets. Today, it is the nexus of six major world cultures, as well as a host of smaller ones that dot the mountain landscape - a place where East meets West, old meets new, and mountain meets plain.</p>

        <p>Во дни печальные разлуки,<br />
        Мои задумчивые звуки,<br />
        Напоминали мне Кавказ,<br />
        Где пасмурный Бешту 1 пустынник величавый,<br />
        Аулов 2 и полей властитель пятиглавый,<br />
        Был новый для меня Парнас.<br />
        Забуду ли его кремнистые вершины,<br />
        Гремучие ключи, увядшие равнины,<br />
        Пустыни знойные, края, где ты со мной<br />
        Делил души младые впечатленья?</p>

        <p>On days darkened by separation,<br />
        The sounds of my meditation,<br />

        Where the stately hermit Mt. Beshtau,<br />
        Five-headed ruler of field and town,<br />
        Was for me another Parnassus.<br />
        Will I forget its stony peaks,<br />

      <p>Traditionally, the Caucasus has been divided into two parts - the North Caucasus and the South Caucasus, or Transcaucasia, each lying on its respective side of the mountain range. Both sub-regions share many qualities: vast steppes that gradually morph into precipitous peaks, deep valleys containing isolated villages, an abiding grandeur and sense of freedom. Historically, however, the two areas have much less in common. The North Caucasus, after playing host to a number of nomadic tribes in addition to the ubiquitous mountain dwellers, was gradually incorporated in the Russian Empire through a series of military campaigns in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The South Caucasus, by comparison, was primarily a vassal of the Persian and, to a lesser degree Ottoman, Empire until the the mid-to-late nineteenth century, when the Russians conquered these areas as well.</p>

      <p>One of the defining factors in community relations in the Caucasus has always been religion and so, although it is tempting to divide the region culturally using the mountain range, in fact it is far more appropriate to do so along an east-west axis. The Georgians and Armenians adopted Christianity in the Middle Ages, which led to close ties with Imperial Russia once the tsar had extended his reach over the mountains. On the other side of the divide, Islam arrived around the same time through the Muslim conquest of Persia, gaining an especially dedicated following among the villages of modern-day Chechnya and Dagestan in the eastern North Caucasus. This difference in faith has served as one of the key underpinnings for nearly three centuries of conflict between Moscow and its Caucasian subjects and neighbors, up to and including the most recent Chechen conflict in the early 2000's.</p>

      <p>Between the successive waves of conquerors and the natural isolation of mountain communities, it comes as little surprise that the Caucasus is extremely ethnically and linguistically diverse. There are approximately sixty languages spoken among nearly as many peoples in an area scarcely larger than New England. These languages belong to six completely distinct linguistic families, with each family bearing almost no resemblance to any of the others grammatically or, to a slightly lesser extent, lexically. And, though Russian was long a lingua franca in most parts of the region, its primacy has declined substantially in Transcaucasia since the fall of the Soviet Union as the new republics of the South Caucasus seek to assert their identities and independence on the international stage.</p>
