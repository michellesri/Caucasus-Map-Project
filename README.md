### Target Audience ###

The app is intended mainly for a Western audience with little knowledge of the Caucasus, interested in learning more or planning a visit to the region.

### Value Delivery ###

Envisioned as an educational tool, the app provides an introduction to the historically rich and linguistically diverse Caucasus, a region made up of six countries straddling Europe and Asia.

The app presents a broad history of the region, comparing its political and linguistic geography, while teaching basic phrases from each of the regionâ€™s major languages.

### Design Goals ###

We led with the desire to create a visually compelling site with consistent visual signaling in order to make the content appealing and easy to navigate for users.

The site opens with a full screen HTML5 video, signaling the regions dramatic history and beauty.

Core to our design goals, two interactive maps leverage CSS animation, JavaScript, and audio to create a visually compelling user interface.

The finished product allows users to understand the geography, language and pronunciation all in a single element.
